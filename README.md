<p>Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9×9 grid with numbers so that each row, column and 3×3 section contain all of the digits between 1 and 9. As a logic puzzle, Sudoku is also an excellent brain game. If you play Sudoku daily, you will soon start to see improvements in your concentration and overall brain power</p>
<p>In this project I will build a sudoku solver by first defining a few methods and then combining these methods to solve any Sudoku puzzle</p>
